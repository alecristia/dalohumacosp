daylong recordings human and machine coding of speech

# human
These scripts are used to extract subparts of the audio recordings (script 1_),
extract minute 4 from those chunks and concatenate them into a single file (script 2_),
for the human to listen through a whole day concatenated from the bits extracted using script 1_ (script 3_),
and finally for the human to hand code the minute 4, still having some of the context (script 4_).

# compAna
This folder contains scripts to compare coding among humans and between humans & machines (1_ and 2_)
And to draw some generalizations over bodies of data (to be added, in progress)
